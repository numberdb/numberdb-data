Title: >
  Complete elliptic integral of the third kind $\Pi(n,m)$

Definition: >
  The list contains the evaluations of the
  complete elliptic integral of the third kind
  $\Pi(n,m) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{(1-n\sin^2 \theta)\sqrt{1-m\sin^2 \theta}} d\theta$
  for some parameters $n$ and $m=k^2$,
  where $k$ is the ellpitic modulus.

Parameters:
  n:
    display: $n$
    type: R
    constraints: $0\leq n < 1$
  m:
    display: $m$
    type: R
    constraints: $0\leq m < 1$
   
Comments:
  comment-k: >
    $\Pi(n,m)$ is also denoted as $\Pi(n,k)$ despite the relation 
    $m=k^2$ between the parameter $m$ and the elliptic modulus $k$.
  comment-sign-of-n: >
    $\Pi(n,m)$ is sometimes defined with the inverse sign of 
    the characteristic $n$.
  comment-sign-of-n: >
    The parameter $n$ can be larger than $1$, 
    although in that case one has to specify how to integrate
    through the singulatiry of the integrand, 
    e.g. by taking the Cauchy principal value.
