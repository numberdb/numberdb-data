Title: >
  $abc$-triples of high merit

Definition: >
  The list contains all known $abc$-triples merit at least $24$, 
  as givin in CITE{ABCatHome}.
  An $abc$-triple is a solution of the equation $a+b=c$ with coprime integers
  $0 < a \leq b < c$.
  The quality of an $abc$-triple is defined as
  $q = \log(c)/\log(r)$, 
  where $r = \text{rad}(abc)$ is the radical of $abc$, that is, 
  the product over all prime divisors of $abc$.
  The merit of an $abc$ triple is defined as 
  $m = (q-1)^2 \log(r) \log\log(r)$.

Comments:
  comment-abc-conjecture: >
    The abc-conjecture CITE{WikiABC} states that $\limsup q = 1$, that is,
    for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there are only finitely many $abc$-triples
    of quality $q > 1+\varepsilon$.
  comment-abc-merit-conjecture: >
    The refined $abc$-conjecture of Robert, Stewart and Tenenbaum CITE{RoStTe14}
    implies that $\limsup m = 48$.

  reliability: >
    The given merit $m$ might not be reliable, 
    in which case it is signified with an asterisk '*':
    By definition, $m$ depends on the prime factorization of $abc$,
    which might be out of reach.
    If this is the case, the large remaining factor of $abc$ is
    heuristically assumed to be square-free, 
    such that a heuristic value for $r$ (and thus for $q$ and $m$) can be deduced.
