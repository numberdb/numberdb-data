Title: >
  $j$-invariants of elliptic curves 
  over quadratic fields 
  with everywhere good reduction

Definition: >
  This table contains the $j$-invariants of elliptic curves $E/K$
  over number fields with absolute discriminant bounded by $|\Delta_K| \leq 20000$,
  such that $E$ has everywhere good reduction.
  
Parameters:
  D:
    display: $\Delta_K$
    title: discriminant of $K$
    type: Z
    
Comments:
  comment-N: >
    An elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$ 
    has everywhere good reduction if and only if its conductor equals $1$.
    In case the class number of $K$ is $1$, this is equivalent to
    the minimal discriminant of $E$ being $1$.
  comment-no-duplicates: >
    Rational $j$-invariants are only listed once, 
    namely for the number field of minimal absolute discriminant.
