Title: >
  Real periods of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ of rank $3$

Definition: >
  The real period $\omega_1$ of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$
  can be defined as $\Omega_E$ if $E(\mathbb{R})$ is connected and
  $\Omega_E/2$ if $E(\mathbb{R})$ has two components, where
  $\Omega_E = \int_{E(\mathbb{R})} |\omega|$,
  $E(\mathbb{R})$ is the set of real points of $E$, 
  and $\omega$ is the invariant differential $dx/(2y+a_1 x+a_3)$
  of a globally minimal model of $E$.
  This table lists $\omega_1$ for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ of
  rank $3$ for the first few conductors.

Comments:
  comment-Omega: >
    Note that some authors refer to $\Omega$ as the real period.
  comment-period-lattice: >
    The period lattice $\Lambda$ of $E$ is 
    the lattice of periods of $\omega$.
    In terms of $\Lambda$, $\omega_1$ is the smallest positive 
    real number in $\Lambda$.
  comment-BSD: >
    The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture CITE{WikiBSD} states that
    $\frac{L^{(r)}(E,1)}{r!} = \frac{|\text{Sha}(E)|\Omega_E R_E \prod_{p|N} c_p}{|E_{\text{Tor}}|^2}$.
  comment-redundancy-of-N: >
    The conductor $N$ can be deduced from $c_4$ and $c_6$.
    We display it for convenience.
  comment-E-from-c4c6: >
    A model of $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is given by $E: y^2 = x^3 - 27 c_4 x - 54 c_6$.
