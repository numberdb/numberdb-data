Title: >
  $abc$-triples of high quality

Definition: >
  The list contains all known $abc$-triples quality at least $1.4$,
  as givin in CITE{ABCatHomeHighQ}.
  An $abc$-triple is a solution of the equation $a+b=c$ with coprime integers
  $0 < a \leq b < c$.
  The quality of an $abc$-triple is defined as
  $q = \log(c)/\log\text{rad}(abc)$, 
  where $\text{rad}(abc)$ is the radical of $abc$, that is, 
  the product over all prime divisors of $abc$.

Comments:
  comment-abc-conjecture: >
    The abc-conjecture CITE{WikiABC} states that $\limsup q = 1$, that is,
    for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there are only finitely many $abc$-triples
    of quality $q > 1+\varepsilon$.
