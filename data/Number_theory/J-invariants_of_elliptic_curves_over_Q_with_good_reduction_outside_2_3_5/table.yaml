Title: >
  $j$-invariants of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with 
  good reduction outside $\{2, 3, 5\}$

Definition: >
  This table contains the $j$-invariants of all 
  elliptic curves $\mathbb{Q}$ with good reduction outside $\{2,3,5\}$.
  
Parameters:
   
Comments:
  comment-minimal-discriminant-and-N: >
    An elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ has good reduction at a prime $p$
    if and only if $p$ does not divide the minimal discriminant of $E$, 
    and equivalently,
    if and only if $p$ does not divide the conductor of $E$.
