Title: >
  Number of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with good redution outside $S$

Definition: >
  Let $S$ be a finite set of primes.
  An elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is said to have 
  good reduction outside $S$ if its minimal discriminant 
  (equivalently, its conductor) is only divisible by primes in $S$.
  This table lists the numbers of elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$
  with good reduction outside $S$ counted in two different ways: 
  up to $\mathbb{Q}$-isomorphism,
  and up to $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-isomorphism.

    Elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with good reduction 
    outside of the first $n$ have been computed by several authors:
    $n=0$ by Tate (see CITE{Ogg}), 
    $n=1$ by Ogg CITE{Ogg},
    $n=2$ by Coghlan CITE{Cog} and Stephens CITE{Ste},
    $n=3,4,5$ by von Känel and Matschke CITE{vKanMat} and 
    Bennett, Gherga and Rechnitzer CITE{BeGhRe},
    $n=6$ heuristically by Best and Matschke CITE{BesMat},
    $n=7,8,9^*$ by Matschke CITE{M-ECDB} ($n=9$ assumes GRH).
