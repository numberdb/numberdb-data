Title: >
  Roots of unity

Definition: >
  The list contains roots of unity, that is, 
  complex solutions of equations of the form $x^n = 1$.
  The $n$'th roots of unity are given as $\exp(2\pi i k/n)$.

Parameters:
  n:
    type: Z
    constraints: $n \geq 1$
  k:
    type: Z
    constraints: $0\leq k < n$
   
Comments:
  comment-primitive-root-of-unity: >
    If $\gcd(k,n) = 1$, $\exp(2\pi i k/n)$ is a called primitive $n$'th root of unity.
    These are the roots of the $n$'th cyclotomic polynomial CITE{WikiCycPoly}.
