Title: Gravitational coupling constant

Definition: >
  The gravitational coupling constant $\alpha_G$ 
  is the dimensionless physical
  constant defined as $\alpha_G = (m_e/m_P)^2$,
  where
  $m_e$ is the electron rest mass, 
  and $m_P$ is the Planck mass.

    $\alpha_G = \frac{Gm_e^2}{\hbar c}$, where
    $G$ is the gravitational constant,
    $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, 
    and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.

    $\alpha_G$ is computed as $(m_e/m_P)^2$,
    where the $m_e$ and $m_P$ are taken as the real intervals
    that contain the measurements in 
    CITE{WikiME} and 
    CITE{WikiMP}
    up to five measurement uncertainties.
